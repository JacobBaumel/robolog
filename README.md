**In progress replacement for FRC Driver Station Console view**
Everyone in FRC knows what the Driverstation is, and everyone knows how bad the console view is. Of course, this only matters if you are using default system prints, and instead relying on a chunky logging library to do the work for you. 

Thats lame. It would be much better if there was another software which provided a light logging library for FRC robots that connected to a nice( r ) looking UI, and could be accessed from multiple computers at once. 

Introducing Robolog! The idea is still very much in progress, but the end goal is to have some simple way to annotate values you want to watch, and any updates to these values will be forwarded to a simple UI which will display them. It will also redirect system prints to this program, so you dont have to use the clunky console view from DS.

I needed a place to dump stuff so I wouldn't lose it, so here we are.

**Still WIP, don't use yet!**
